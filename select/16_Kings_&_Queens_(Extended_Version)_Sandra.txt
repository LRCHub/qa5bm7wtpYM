Take me
Into your dream
Push reality a bit further
Hold me
Right in your arms
Making this moment forever

When a thousand people
Come across the land
They stay all together
And raise their hands

We'll be kings and queens
The crown is in our hands
Ohh ohh our love will write history
We'll be kings and queens
We hold the golden band
Ohh the birth of a new century

We'll be kings and queens
The crown is in our hands
Ohh ohh our love will write history
We'll be kings and queens
We hold the golden band
Ohh the birth of a new century

Right here
Look in my eyes
Circle of hallucination
Feel me
The fire inside
Drawing for your animation

When a thousand people
Come across the land
They stay all together
And raise their hands

We'll be kings and queens
The crown is in our hands
Ohh ohh our love will write history
We'll be kings and queens
We hold the golden band
Ohh the birth of a new century

Ohh
Ohh ohh

We'll be kings and queens
The crown is in our hands
Ohh ohh our love will write history
We'll be kings and queens
We hold the golden band
Ohh the birth of a new century

(Ohh ohh) / we'll be kings and queens
The crown is in our hands
Ohh ohh our love will write history
